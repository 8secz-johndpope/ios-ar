### Ideas for bomb game:

- game starts
- tasks need to be done before giving other player the phone
- there is a **hidden random max counter/limit** at which the "bomb" explodes
- **screen and/or sound noises changes color depending counter/limit**
- screen shows you what to do or show rules before the game starts
- one global timer for all players
- maximum punishment (bomb explodes faster) for each players turn, lose otherwise
- max timer for each players turn (bomb explodes immediately)
- always two or three tasks per player, next player after these tasks
- game ends when counter/limit is reached (person who hold it last loses)

### Task 1: Tap on phone:
- tap with finger on phone to create a sound recording in a specific rythm
- three tries for the rythm, punishment when failing

### Task 2: Unwrap the phone**
- unwrap in x, y or z rotation but always 360 so the user can see the screen
- no tries, no timer, just solve it

### Task 3: Deliver to next player**
- hand over to next player and punish if too much shaking
- timer for delivery
- stop and go (freeze) mechanic

### Punishment for too much shaking:**
- the bomb explodes when it was shaked too much
