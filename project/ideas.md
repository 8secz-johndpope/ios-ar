**Ideas for bomb game:**

- game starts
- tasks need to be done before giving other player the phone
- there is a random max counter/limit at which the "bomb" explodes
- screen and/or sound noises changes color depending counter/limit
- screen shows you what to do or show rules before the game starts
- first "unlock" the bomb before performing other tasks
- game ends when counter/limit is reached (person who hold it last loses)


- hp for each player, player lose hp when failing tasks
- timer for each player or one global timer for all players

**Tasks:**

- tap with finger on phone to create a sound recording in a specific rythm
- three tries for the rythm, punishment when failing
- unwrap or tap to unlock?
- unwrap in x, y or z rotation but always 360 so the user can see the screen
- (hide light sensor with finger, more light sensored means worse)
